## Propensify: A Propensity Model for Optimized Marketing Campaigns

### Introduction
In today's competitive landscape, understanding customer behavior is key to developing successful marketing strategies. While businesses invest heavily in data-driven campaigns, many struggle to maximize returns due to the ineffective use of customer data. Organizations often have vast datasets, but these may be outdated, incomplete, or irrelevant, limiting their impact.

Propensity modeling offers a solution by predicting the likelihood of a customer taking a specific action. Through statistical analysis, it assesses various independent and confounding factors influencing behavior. As part of an initiative to enhance marketing efficiency for an insurance company, I have been tasked with building a propensity model to identify high-potential customers for targeted campaigns.

### Data Overview
Two key datasets were used for this project:

- **train.xlsx**: Contains historical customer data, including demographics, past marketing interactions, and insurance purchase outcomes. It features both numerical and categorical variables for model training.
- **test.xlsx**: Includes a list of potential customers for whom predictions will be made using the trained model.

### Project Components

2. **Propensify – Machine Learning Model.pdf**: A detailed report covering design decisions, performance evaluation, and recommendations for future work.

### Methodological Approach
To effectively address the business problem, the following steps were undertaken:

#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A thorough EDA was conducted to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within the datasets. Descriptive statistics and visualizations were employed to gain insights into key variables and interactions.

#### 2. Data Cleaning
The dataset was standardized to address issues like missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring the integrity and quality of the data.

#### 3. Handling Imbalanced Data
As the data showed significant class imbalance, appropriate techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) were implemented to ensure balanced training samples for model development.

#### 4. Feature Engineering
New features were created and existing ones were transformed to enhance model performance. This included scaling numerical variables, encoding categorical features, and generating interaction terms.

#### 5. Model Selection
A range of machine learning algorithms were evaluated to identify the most suitable model, including decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and logistic regression. 

#### 6. Model Training
The dataset was split into training and testing sets. The training data was used to optimize model parameters through cross-validation, grid search, and hyperparameter tuning.

#### 7. Model Validation
The trained model was evaluated on the test set to ensure generalizability and to identify issues such as overfitting. Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were assessed.

#### 8. Model Deployment
The final model was deployed, enabling it to be used for predictive analysis in a real-world production environment.

### Results and Future Work
The Propensify model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 90.35%, providing valuable insights to guide future marketing efforts and improve customer engagement. These predictions can significantly enhance campaign efficiency by focusing resources on high-propensity customers.

Moving forward, the model can be further refined by incorporating additional data sources and exploring advanced techniques like deep learning to improve predictive power and adaptability.

### Conclusion
The Propensify project demonstrates a robust and structured approach to predicting customer behavior. The insights gained from this propensity model offer a practical solution for optimizing marketing strategies, driving higher customer conversion rates, and ultimately achieving positive business outcomes.
